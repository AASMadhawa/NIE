            <h2>Corporate Values</h2>
            <p>
                The NIE as a corporate body advocates professional collegiality and cohesiveness and endeavors to inculcate
                 a sense of belongingness in all its members leading to self motivation and satisfaction by recognizing and 
                 respecting individual talents and achievements. Every member of the organization is accorded just, fair and 
                 equitable treatment and individual initiative is promoted encouraging self-development. In return a high degree 
                 of self-discipline and loyalty to the institute is expected of its members along with serious concern for 
                 responsibility and accountability, both individual and collective. Participatory approaches and pro-active planning 
                 are encouraged to facilitate adaptability to change. Demonstrable transparency is considered to be of utmost importance. 
                 Concern for the image of the institute by all members at all times is emphasized. Positive and critical examination and 
                 the adoption of constructive approaches for organizational development are always encouraged. The NIE is a public 
                 corporation and therefore relies on purposeful, planned and continuous public relation approaches to maintain close 
                 links with the public. At the same time, attempts are made to develop strong external linkages in order to gain wider 
                 recognition and keep pace with contemporary global developments. Continuous improvement through reflective practices 
                 will remain a major concern of the Institute. In addition to being a public corporation the NIE is a competing agent 
                 in the education enterprise and is therefore concerned with the production of marketable products and marketing. In this 
                 respect, it is very much concerned with high quality and competitiveness in its products and services. The goals implicit 
                 in the mission statement are elaborated in the following corporate level and operational level objectives.
